## Overview and Origin
![morning star logo](https://www.logosvgpng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/morningstar-logo-vector.png)


   MorningStar, Inc is a financial consulting and news providing company founded in 1984 by Joe Mansuto. Its purpose is to empower individuals to achieve their financial dreams by publishing important information. It offers a wide array of products ranging from financial news, wealth management, and investment management. They pride themselves in providing great financial advice by "understanding the individual's hopes, dreams, and ideals" [12](https://www.morningstar.com/company). 
The idea for the company came about in 1982 while Mansuto was reviewing the annual report of Mutual Funds, however it did not come to fruition until 1984. During those two years, Mansueto worked as a stock analyst for a Chicago firm. That gave him the opportunity to study the market and its competitors. Mansueto claims that most of his inspiration came after being introduced to Warren Buffet from the book "The Money Masters" by Harper and Row [1](https://www.inc.com/magazine/19990701/811.html). Mansueto used his knowledge acquired from Buffet to catapult his idea into existence.

   Joe Mansueto invested $80,000 to give rise Morningstar, Inc [2](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-11-14-mansueto_x.htm) . Since then it attracted the interest of other stakeholders such Softbank, who invested $91 million in return for 20 percent of the company. This joint venture was meant to help Morningstar accelerate their internet business [3](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/09/business/company-news-softbank-says-it-will-invest-91-million-in-morningstar.html). On May 3, 2005 Morningstar went public by offering its first stocks at $18.50  [4](https://newsroom.morningstar.com/newsroom/news-archive/press-release-details/2005/Morningstar-Inc-Prices-Initial-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx). The value of the stock has since then skyrocketed, and closed the market on March 5th, at $236.67. Morningstar also offers its services globally by operating in 11 offices in 9 countries, and manages over $234.7 billion in assets [2](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-11-14-mansueto_x.htm).




## Business Activities:

   Morningstar's mission is to empower investors to make better financial decision. Mansueto founded the company because he found it unfair that the general public did not have access to the same information as finance professionals. Most individuals did not know how to invest, where to invest, and let alone where to get the information to make sound decisions[5](https://www.morningstar.com/insights/2019/06/18/great-advice). It currently offers a variety of products which include: Morningstar Investor Newsletter, Strategic Solutions, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, Morningstar Retirement Manager, and DBRS Morningstar which is a global credit rating agency which competes with Moody's and the S&P [6](https://www.morningstar.com/products). The company's intended customers are individuals who are in needs of financial information, specifically investors or advisors. They could be finance professionals or anybody in need of financial information.

   Morningstar's competitive advantage was influenced by Warren Buffet. Warren Buffet defined economic moat, or competitive advantage, as an advantage that is very hard to replicate and has a high return rate. Typically, that advantage does not stem from technology because it is not sustainable and be can easily replicated. Morningstar's moat comes from their staff, and the approach they take to guide their clients. They differentiate themselves from their competitors because they focus on their customers' journeys instead of the final result. Morningstar also boast from their reputation as one of the best, which gives them an advantage over other companies.

    As a Fintech company, Morningstar heavily relies on technology in their every day activities. According to Stackshare, they use 32 applications, four utilities, two DevOps and three Business tools. Some of the more well known tools they use include Java, Jquery, PHP, Cloudflare, Google Analytics, and New Relic [9](https://stackshare.io/morningstar/morningstar/main).

## Landscape:

   Morningstar is mainly known for being a great source of financial information. But just like most fintech companies, Morningstar also dables in other domains. They offer products and services to assist in investment management and wealth management. They are also well-known for their highly reputable credit rating agency, which is the fourth largest credit ratings agency and a market leader in Canada, the U.S. and Europe in multiple asset classes [13](https://www.dbrsmorningstar.com/about/). They pride themselves in their size and approach which provides them with the flexibility of providing great service to their customers while also being large enough to provide the necessary expertise and resources. Over the last five to ten years, most of the companies within the financial news industry have been reinventing their approach to the distribution of information. They have gone from being paper-base to mostly being online. One of the most recent changes has been due to the pandemic. More and more employees are requesting accomation for remote work. This has brought new challenges as employers struggle to accomadate workers, motivate them, keep them connected, and productive [10](https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2021/02/05/6-trends-that-will-shape-the-financial-services-industry-in-2021/?sh=74a491b342b6). The change in work  environment has also forced them to adapt to the needs of their customers, who may no longer require in person help.

  Morningstar operates in many domains because they offer many services including: financial information, wealth management, and credit rating. The main domain that Morningstar operates in is the financial information industry and their main competitors would be Bloomberg, Marketwatch, and Thomson Reuthers [11](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051915/who-are-morningstars-morn-main-competitors.asp#:~:text=Three%20of%20Morningstar's%20key%20competitors,activity%20and%20generate%20detailed%20reports.). In the domain of wealth management, major companies include Schwabb, Morgan Stanley, Goldmans Sachs and others [7](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061314/best-best-wealth-management-firms.asp). Major companies in the investment management industry are Blackrock, Vanguard, UBS Group, Fidelity and others  [6](https://www.thebalance.com/which-firms-have-the-most-assets-under-management-4173923). When it comes to credit rating, Morningstar mainly competes with the S&P,Moodys, and Fitch [8](https://www.financial-planning.com/news/morningstar-acquires-mbs-rater-realpoint). However its credit rating agency is no longer associated with the SEC, and are even being sued by them.

## Results

   Morningstar is mostly known for providing key financial information. They used to have a credit rating agency that was very well known, however, as of November 2020, DBRS, inc no longer recognized them as one of their affiliates. Because it is a highly reputable entity, many newcomer investors, as well as experienced finacial analyst depend on Morningstar. Investors depend on these key performance indicators to make important financial moves.

   There are many key performance indicators used to measure success in the domain of asset management. Success may be defined by how profitable a company or fund is, what their debt looks like, how quick they sell their inventory, or how their stock is performing in the  market. When looking at profitability, core metrics used tend to be the net profit margin and gross profit margin. When looking at how a company manages their debt or obligation, popular metrics used tend to be: leverage, quick ratio, and current ratio [12](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/financial-performance-measures). Success may also be measured by how quick inventory is turned over, or how efficiently assets are used to create revenue in which case they would use the inventory turnover ratio or the asset turnover ratio.

   In terms of evaluating the success of funds, Morningstar uses different metrics to measure their protitabily and risk . One of these metrics is the Downside Capture Ratio which  calculates the extent to which a fund's performance mirrors that of its benchmark during the months in which the benchmark lost ground  [12](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/754052/using-risk-measures-on-morningstar-fund-reports)." The S&P 500 is used as the benchmark for domestically funded stocks. For internationally funded stocks, the MSCI All Country World ex-US Index is used. For Bonds funds, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is used.
Another metric that is used is the Mornigstar Risk Rating which looks at how a fund is performing in regards to its peers, with an emphasis on downward volatility. They also use the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, as well as the Standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio calculates a fund's performance compared to the risks it takes. It is based on the fund's standard deviation and its excess return above the risk-free rate. Similarly, the Sortino ratio does the same but with an emphasis on downside performance. Finally, the standard deviation calculates how much a fund's performance fluctuates over time.


## Recommendations


   Currently the more popular companies in the domain of financial news are Marketwatch, Bloomberg, and Reuters. They dominate most of the marketshare. After reviewing Morningstar's competitors, and the products they offer, I would suggest that Morningstar create an easy to use phone application. Marketwatch's app already has over a million downloads and many good reviews, however Morningstar does not offer a similar service. They do have an application for managers, but it has only a few thousand downloads and many negative reviews. I think offering this product would be great because it would help Morningstar become more competitive. Mobile applications such as Webull and Robinhood have broken down barriers of entry, and made it easier for individuals to trade. With an influx of investors comes a demand for information as well. I believe that if Morningstar provided their services through mobile, they would be able to tap into a larger pool of customers. I personally trade through Robinhood and have noticed that many Marketwatch articles are featured on there. However, I have not come accross articles from Morningstar, and I believe this is a missed opportunity for Morningstar.
Stepping into this realm would require Morningstar to expand their services beyond the archaic ways of computers, and to transition into mobile phones and tablets.
This technology is appropriate in order to attract more customers. This strategy would also help become more competitive.
