![morning star logo](https://www.logosvgpng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/morningstar-logo-vector.png)


MorningStar, Inc is a financial consulting company founded in 1984 by Joe Mansuto. Its purpose is to empower individuals to achieve their financial dreams by offering important information. They pride themselves in providing great financial advice by "understanding the individual's hopes, dreams, and ideals." 

The idea for the company came about in 1982 while Mansuto was reviewing the annual report of Mutual Funds. However, the idea of the company did not bear fruit until 1984. He decided he needed to learn more about the market and competitors, and therefore worked for a year as a stock analyst for a Chicago investment firm. Mansueto claims that most of his inspiration came after being introduced to Warren Buffet from the book "The Money Masters" by Harper and Row [1](https://www.inc.com/magazine/19990701/811.html). 

After the inception of the idea, Mansueto invested $80,000 to give birth to Morningstar [2](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-11-14-mansueto_x.htm) . Since then it has attracted the interest of other stakeholders such Softbank, who invested $91 million in return of 20 percent of the company. This joint venture was meant to help them accelerate their internet business [3](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/09/business/company-news-softbank-says-it-will-invest-91-million-in-morningstar.html). On May 3, 2005 Morningstar priced its initial public offering at $18.50  [4](https://newsroom.morningstar.com/newsroom/news-archive/press-release-details/2005/Morningstar-Inc-Prices-Initial-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx). Its stock is now valued at more than 100 times its initial price. It has since expanded its services around the globe, and operates in 11 offices in 9 countries and manages over $234.7 billion in assets [2](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-11-14-mansueto_x.htm).




## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Morningstar's mission is to empower investors. Mansueto founded the company because he found it unfair that people did not have access to the same financial information as financial individuals. Less than half of Americans are on track for retirement, and there is not enough financial success stories. Morningstar's mission is to empower individuals to achieve financial security [5](https://www.morningstar.com/insights/2019/06/18/great-advice). It currently offers a variety of products which include: Morningstar Investor Newsletter, Strategic Solutions, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, Morningstar Retirement Manager, and DBRS Morningstar which is a global credit rating agency which competes with Moody's and the S&P [6](https://www.morningstar.com/products).

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The company's intended customers are individuals who are in needs of financial information. Those could be individuals investors, investment advisors, or anybody in need of financial news, advice, or information.


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)


Morningstar's competitive advantage was influenced by Warren Buffet. Their economic moat, or competitive advantage, stems from an advantage that is very hard to replicate and has a high return rate. They don't believe that an advantage that comes from technology is not sustainable because that can easily be replicated. Morningstar's competitive advantage comes from their reputation. They also differentiate themselves from their competitors because they focus on their customers' journeys instead of the final result.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

As a Fintech company, Morningstar heavily relies on technology in their every day activities. According to Stackshare, Morningstar uses 32 applications, four utilities, two DevOps and three Business tools. Some of the more well known tools they use include Java, Jquery, PHP, Cloudflare, Google Analytics, and New Relic [9](https://stackshare.io/morningstar/morningstar/main).

## Landscape:

Morningstar is mainly known for being a great source of Financial information. But, they also operate in the domains of investment management and wealth management. Morningstar is also known for its highly reputable credit rating agency.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The pandemic has pushed forward many new trends in the Fintech industry. One of the more obvious trends over the past year has been remote working. This has brought new challenges as employers struggle to accomadate workers, motivate them, keep them productive, and connected as well [10](https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2021/02/05/6-trends-that-will-shape-the-financial-services-industry-in-2021/?sh=74a491b342b6).

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Morningstar operates in many domains because they offer many services including: financial information, wealth management, and credit rating. The main domain that Morningstar operates in is the financial information industry. The main competitors in this industry are Bloomberg, Marketwatch, and Thomson Reuthers  [11](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051915/who-are-morningstars-morn-main-competitors.asp#:~:text=Three%20of%20Morningstar's%20key%20competitors,activity%20and%20generate%20detailed%20reports.).In the domain of wealth management, major companies include Schwabb, Morgan Stanley, Goldmans Sachs and others [7](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061314/best-best-wealth-management-firms.asp).

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Morningstar is mostly known for providing key financial information. They used to have a credit rating agency that was very well known, however, as of November 2020, DBRS, inc no longer recognized them as one of their affiliates. Because it is a highly reputable entity, many newcomer investors, as well as experienced finacial analyst depend on Morningstar. The information they receive allows them to track trends, in order to make key decisions.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

There are many key performance indicators used to measure success in the domain of asset management. Success may be defined by how profitable a company or fund is, what their debt looks like, how quick they sell their inventory, or how their stock is performing in the  market. When looking at profitability, core metrics used tend to be the net profit margin and gross profit margin. When looking at how a company manages their debt or obligation, popular metrics used tend to be: leverage, quick ratio, and current ratio [12](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/financial-performance-measures). Success may also be measured by how quick inventory is turned over, or how efficiently assets are used to create revenue in which case they would use the inventory turnover ratio or the asset turnover ratio.

Morningstar uses many metrics to measure the protitabily and risk of funds. One of these metrics is the downside capture ratio which  Calculates the extent to which a fund's performance mirrored that of its benchmark during months in which the benchmark lost ground  [12](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/754052/using-risk-measures-on-morningstar-fund-reports)." The S&P 500 is used as the benchmark for domestically funded stocks. For internationally funded stocks, the MSCI All Country World ex-US Index is used. For Bonds funds, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is used.

Another metric that is used is the Mornigstar Risk Rating which looks at how a fund is performing in regards to its peers, with an emphasis on downward volatility. They also use the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, as well as the Standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio calculates a fund's performance compared to the risks it takes. It is based on the fund's standard deviation and its excess return above the risk-free rate. Similarly the Sortino ratio does the same but with an emphasis on downside performance. Finally, the standard deviation calculates how much a fund's performance fluctuates over time.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Currently the more popular companies in the domain of financial news are Marketwatch, Bloomberg, Reuters, and others. These companies, along with others, dominate most of the share of the market

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

After reviewing Morningstar's competitors, and the products they offer, I would suggest that Morningstar create an easy to use phone application. Marketwatch's app already has over a million downloads and many good reviews, however Morningstar does not offer a similar service. They do have an application for managers, but it has only a few thousand downloads and many negative reviews.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I think offering this product would be great because it would help Morningstar become more competitive. Mobile applications such as Webull and Robinhood have broken down barriers of entry and made it easier for individuals to trade. With an influx of investors comes a demand for information as well, and I believe that if Morningstar provided their services mobilly, they would be able to tap into a larger pool of customers. I personally trade on Robinhood, and they have this option that provides financial news. I have comes accross articles from Marketwatch, but I have not come accross articles from Morningstar.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

This additional product would require that Morningstar expand their services beyond the archaic ways of computers, and to transition into mobile phones and tablets.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

This technology is appropriate in order to attract more customers. This strategy would also help become more competitive.
