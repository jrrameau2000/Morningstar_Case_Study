![morning star logo](https://www.logosvgpng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/morningstar-logo-vector.png)


MorningStar, Inc is a financial consulting company founded in 1984 by Joe Mansuto. Its purpose is to empower individuals to achieve their financial dreams by offering important information. They pride themselves in providing great financial advice by "understanding the individual's hopes, dreams, and ideals." 

The idea for the company came about in 1982 while Mansuto was reviewing the annual report of Mutual Funds. However, the idea of the company did not bear fruit until 1984. He decided he needed to learn more about the market and competitors, and therefore worked for a year as a stock analyst for a Chicago investment firm. Mansueto claims that most of his inspiration came after being introduced to Warren Buffet from the book "The Money Masters" by Harper and Row [1](https://www.inc.com/magazine/19990701/811.html). 

After the inception of the idea, Mansueto invested $80,000 to give birth to Morningstar [2](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-11-14-mansueto_x.htm) . Since then it has attracted the interest of other stakeholders such Softbank, who invested $91 million in return of 20 percent of the company. This joint venture was meant to help them accelerate their internet business [3](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/09/business/company-news-softbank-says-it-will-invest-91-million-in-morningstar.html). On May 3, 2005 Morningstar priced its initial public offering at $18.50  [4](https://newsroom.morningstar.com/newsroom/news-archive/press-release-details/2005/Morningstar-Inc-Prices-Initial-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx). Its stock is now valued at more than 100 times its initial price. It has since expanded its services around the globe, and operates in 11 offices in 9 countries and manages over $234.7 billion in assets [2](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-11-14-mansueto_x.htm).




## Business Activities:

Morningstar's mission is to empower investors. Mansueto founded the company because he found it unfair that people did not have access to the same financial information as financial individuals.

It currently offers a variety of products which include: Morningstar Investor Newsletter, Strategic Solutions, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, Morningstar Retirement Manager, and DBRS Morningstar which is a global credit rating agency which competes with Moody's and the S&P [6](https://www.morningstar.com/products).
